# C Chat App

"Simple" chat application built using c.

## Purpose

The purpose of this app is not to be practical or useful. This was simply a project built by me for fun. 

## Features

1. **RESTful backend API:** The server boasts a RESTful API that can be called by other client applications.
2. **Distinct group chats:** The server can handle mutliple distinct group chats on the same port. 
3. **Server Logging:** The server logs the messages sent in each group chat into its own text file. Each group chat gets its own log.
